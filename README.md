# Functional Programming in Scala

This repository contains code and projects completed as part of the **Functional Programming in Scala** course, offered by **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)** and taught by **Martin Odersky**, the creator of Scala.

## Course Overview

This course consists of six modules and focuses on functional programming, a paradigm increasingly adopted in the software industry.
Scala is the primary language used in the course, due to its fusion of functional programming and object-oriented programming.
The course covers how Scala interoperates with Java and is a key language for important frameworks such as Apache Spark, Kafka. 

### Course Objectives

- Understand functional programming and its real-world applications.
- Master Scala syntax and functional programming principles.
- Develop the ability to reason about functional programs.
- Gain hands-on experience through a series of programming projects.
